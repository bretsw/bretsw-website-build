# Hi, I'm Bret.

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of [Instructional Systems & Learning Technologies](https://education.fsu.edu/instructional-systems-and-learning-technologies) at Florida State University.

My research investigates *networked learning in online communities*. I explore this area in four ways. First, I study informal learning environments such as those supported by social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Second, I examine the identity-agency needed to navigate these environments, especially during disruptions and transitions. Third, I write about and seek greater understanding of technoethical issues raised by seeking professional learning in social networks. Fourth, and finally, I am interested in data science applications for educational research, such as the principles of open science, data mining of digital traces, social network analysis, and learning analytics. 

- I have authored 15 peer-reviewed academic journal articles, 6 edited book chapters, and 42 conference presentations. 
- I developed the [{tidytags}](https://github.com/bretsw/tidytags) package for the statistical programming language R to assist other researchers in collecting and analyzing Twitter data. 
- I deliver professional development workshops on using R for data science in educational research. 
- I currently serve as the Communications Officer for the [Research & Theory Division](https://sites.google.com/view/aectrtd/home) of the Association for Educational Communications & Technology (AECT) and the Executive Coach for [Black in Gaming](https://www.thebigfoundation.org/).

I hold a [Ph.D. in Educational Psychology & Educational Technology](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/epet/), a [Master's Degree in Educational Technology](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/maet/), and a [Graduate Certificate in Serious Game Design and Research](https://comartsci.msu.edu/academics/academic-departments/media-information/graduate/serious-game-design-ma-certificate) from Michigan State University, and a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and sociology from Bucknell University. 

I consider my strongest credential to be my ongoing friendship with my very first online friend, who I met in an AOL chatroom in the early 1990s.
