I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Educational Psychology & Educational Technology](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/epet/) at Michigan State University. I hold a [Master's Degree in Educational Technology](https://education.msu.edu/cepse/maet/) and a [Graduate Certificate in Serious Game Design and Research](https://comartsci.msu.edu/academics/academic-departments/media-information/graduate/serious-game-design-ma-certificate) from Michigan State University, and a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and sociology from Bucknell University. I consider my strongest credential to be my ongoing friendship with my very first online friend, who I met in an AOL chatroom in the early 1990s.

I have written more extensively about my [research agenda](post/research-statement), [teaching philosophy](post/teaching-statement), and [diversity beliefs](post/diversity-statement) in dedicated posts, but I offer brief introductions to my research, teaching, and service here.

## Research

I research *networked learning* in online communities. Specifically, I explore issues of agency in navigating the learning spaces afforded by social media. I use educational data mining and learning analytics approaches to understand the ways people participate in these novel, often informal, online learning environments. My work has been disseminated through 12 peer-reviewed academic journal articles, 6 edited book  chapters, and 39 conference presentations.

## Teaching

I teach each of the Master’s courses in MSU’s [Graduate Certificate in Online Teaching and Learning](http://education.msu.edu/academics/graduate-specializations-certificates/#online-teaching-learning), as well as a course to help undergraduate preservice teachers think critically about using technology for teaching and learning.

## Service

I currently serve as Communications Officer of AECT's Research & Theory Division (2020-21) and Co-chair of SITE's Social Media SIG (2019-21). Since June 2020, I have been serving as the Executive Coach for [Black in Gaming](http://www.blackingaming.org). In 2019 I received a [Disciplinary Leadership Award](https://grad.msu.edu/2019-20-cogs-disciplinary-leadership-award-recipients) from Michigan State University.
